# Introduction

## Acknowledgement
This note is based on  "Introduction to Econometrics with R". https://www.econometrics-with-r.org/index.html

## Preliminary: packages

- We use the following packages:
    - `AER` : 
    - `dplyr` : data manipulation
    - `stargazer` : output of regression results

``` {r}

# Install package if you have not done so 
# install.packages("AER")
# install.packages("dplyr")
# install.packages("stargazer")
# install.packages("lmtest")

# load packages
library("AER")
library("dplyr")
library("stargazer")
library("lmtest")

## Empirical setting: Data from California School

- Question: How does the student-teacher ratio affects test scores?
- We use data from California school, which is included in `AER` package. 
    - See here for the details: https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/AER/versions/1.2-6/topics/CASchools

```{r}
# load the the data set in the workspace
data(CASchools)
```

---

- Use `class()` function to see `CASchools` is `data.frame` object.
```{r}
class(CASchools)
```

- We take 2 steps for the analysis.
    - Step 1: Look at data (descriptive analysis) 
    - Step 2: Run regression
    
## Step 1: Descriptive analysis

- It is always important to grasp your data before running regression. 
- `head()` function give you a first overview of the data.

```{r}
head(CASchools)

```

- Alternatively, you can use `browse()` to see the entire dataset in browser window.

## Create variables

- Create several variables that are needed for the analysis.
- We use `dplyr` for this purpose.

```{r}
CASchools %>% 
  mutate( STR = students / teachers ) %>% 
  mutate( score = (read + math) / 2 ) -> CASchools 

```


## Descriptive statistics

- There are several ways to show descriptive statistics
- The standard one is to use `summary()` function

```{r}
summary(CASchools)

```

- This returns the desriptive statistics for all the variables in dataframe.
- You can combine this with `dplyr::select` 

```{r}
CASchools %>% 
  select(STR, score) %>%
  summary()

```

- You can do a bit lengthly thing manually like this.

```{r}
# compute sample averages of STR and score
avg_STR <- mean(CASchools$STR) 
avg_score <- mean(CASchools$score)

# compute sample standard deviations of STR and score
sd_STR <- sd(CASchools$STR) 
sd_score <- sd(CASchools$score)

# set up a vector of percentiles and compute the quantiles 
quantiles <- c(0.10, 0.25, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.75, 0.9)
quant_STR <- quantile(CASchools$STR, quantiles)
quant_score <- quantile(CASchools$score, quantiles)

# gather everything in a data.frame 
DistributionSummary <- data.frame(Average = c(avg_STR, avg_score), 
                                  StandardDeviation = c(sd_STR, sd_score), 
                                  quantile = rbind(quant_STR, quant_score))

# print the summary to the console
DistributionSummary
```

- My personal favorite is to use `stargazer` function.

```{r}

stargazer(CASchools, type = "text")

```

- You can choose summary statistics you want to report.

```{r}

CASchools %>% 
  stargazer( type = "text", summary.stat = c("n", "p75", "sd") ) 

```

- See https://www.jakeruss.com/cheatsheets/stargazer/#the-default-summary-statistics-table for the details.
- We will use `stargazer` to report regression results.


## Scatter plot

- Let's see how test score and student-teacher-ratio is correlated. 

```{r}

plot(score ~ STR, 
     data = CASchools,
     main = "Scatterplot of TestScore and STR", 
     xlab = "STR (X)",
     ylab = "Test Score (Y)")


```

- Use `cor()` to compute the correlation between two numeric vectors.
```{r}
cor(CASchools$STR, CASchools$score)
``` 

## Step 2: Run regression

## Simple linear regression

- We use `lm()` function to run linear regression
- First, consider the simple linear regression 
\[
score_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 size_i + \epsilon_i
\]
where $size_i$ is the class size (student-teacher-ratio).
    - From now on we call student-teacher-ratio (STR) class size.
- To run this regression, we use `lm`

```{r}
# First, we rename the variable `STR`
CASchools %>% 
  dplyr::rename( size = STR) -> CASchools

# Run regression and save results in the varaiable `model1_summary`
model1_summary <- lm( score ~ size, data = CASchools)

# See the results
summary(model1_summary)

```

- Interpretations
    - An increase of one student per teacher leads to 2.2 point decrease in test scores. 
    - p value is very small. The effect of the class size on test score is significant.
        Note: Be careful. These standard errors are NOT heteroskedasiticity robust. We will come back to this point soon.
    - $R^2 = 0.051$, implying that 5.1% of the variance of the dependent variable is explained by the model.
    
- You can add more variable in the regression (will see this soon)

## Correction of Robust standard error

- We use `vcovHC()` function, a partof the package `sandwich`, to obtain the robust standard errors.
    - The package `sandwich` is automatically loaded if you load `AER` package.

```{r}

# compute heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors
vcov <- vcovHC(model1_summary, type = "HC1")

# get standard error: the square root of the diagonal element in vcov
robust_se <- sqrt(diag(vcov))
robust_se

```

- Notice that robust standard errors are larger than the one we obtained from `lm`!
- How to combine the robust standard errors with the original summary? Use `coeftest()` from the package `lmtest`

```{r}

# load `lmtest`
library(lmtest)

# Combine robust standard errors
coeftest(model1_summary, vcov. = vcov)

```

## Report by Stargazer

- `stargazer` is useful to show the regression result. 

```{r}

# load
library(stargazer)

# Create output by stargazer
stargazer::stargazer(model1_summary, type ="text")

```

- Use robust standard errors in stargazer output

```{r}

# Prepare robust standard errors in list
rob_se <- list( sqrt(diag(vcovHC(model1_summary, type = "HC1") ) ) ) 

# generate regression table. 

stargazer( model1_summary, 
           se = rob_se, 
           type = "text")


```


## Full results

Taken from https://www.econometrics-with-r.org/7-6-analysis-of-the-test-score-data-set.html

```{r}

# load the stargazer library

# estimate different model specifications
spec1 <- lm(score ~ size, data = CASchools)
spec2 <- lm(score ~ size + english, data = CASchools)
spec3 <- lm(score ~ size + english + lunch, data = CASchools)
spec4 <- lm(score ~ size + english + calworks, data = CASchools)
spec5 <- lm(score ~ size + english + lunch + calworks, data = CASchools)

# gather robust standard errors in a listh
rob_se <- list(sqrt(diag(vcovHC(spec1, type = "HC1"))),
               sqrt(diag(vcovHC(spec2, type = "HC1"))),
               sqrt(diag(vcovHC(spec3, type = "HC1"))),
               sqrt(diag(vcovHC(spec4, type = "HC1"))),
               sqrt(diag(vcovHC(spec5, type = "HC1"))))

# generate a LaTeX table using stargazer
stargazer(spec1, spec2, spec3, spec4, spec5,
          se = rob_se,
          digits = 3,
          header = F,
          column.labels = c("(I)", "(II)", "(III)", "(IV)", "(V)"),
          type ="text", 
          keep.stat = c("N", "adj.rsq"))

```

- The coefficient on the class size decreases as we add more explantory variables. Can you explain why? (Hint: omitted variable bias)
