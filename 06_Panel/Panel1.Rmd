## Introduction

- Panel data has observations on $n$ cross-sectional units at $T$ time periods: $(X_{it}, Y_{it}$
- Examples:
    1. Person $i$'s income in year $t$.
    2. Vote share in county $i$ for the presidential election year $t$.
    3. Country $i$'s GDP in year $t$. 
- Panel data is useful because
    1. More variation (both cross-sectional and temporal variation)
    2. Can deal with time-invariant unobserved factors. 
    3. (Not focus in this course) Dynamics of individual over time. 
  
## Overview

- Consider the model
$$
y_{it} = \beta' x_{it} + \epsilon_{it}, E[\epsilon_{it} | x_{it} ] = 0
$$
where $x_{it}$ is a k-dimensional vector
- If there is no correlation between $x_{it}$ and $\epsilon_{it}$, you can estimate the model by OLS **(pooled OLS)**
- A natural concern here is the omitted variable bias. 
- We now consider that $\epsilon_{it}$ is written as
$$
\epsilon_{it} = \alpha_i + u_{it}
$$
where $\alpha_i$ is called **unit fixed effect**, which is the time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity. 

--- 

- With panel data, we can control for the unit fixed effects by incorporating the dummy variable for each unit $i$!
$$
y_{it} = \beta' x_{it} + \gamma_2 D2_i + \cdots + \gamma_n Dn_i + u_{it}
$$
where $Dl_i$ takes 1 if $l=i$. 
    - Notice that we cannot do this for the cross-section data!
- We often write the model with unit FE as 
$$
y_{it} = \beta' x_{it} + \alpha_i + u_{it}
$$

## Framework
- The fixed effects model
$$
y_{it} = \beta' x_{it} + \alpha_i + u_{it}
$$
- Assumptions:
    1. $u_{it}$ is uncorrelated with $(x_{i1},\cdots, x_{iT})$, that is $E[u_{it}|x_{i1},\cdots, x_{iT} ] = 0$
    2. $(Y_{it}, x_{it})$ are independent across individual $i$.
    3. No outliers
    4. No Perfect multicollinarity
- Let's discuss Assumptions 1, 2, and 4 in detail. 

--- 

- Assumption 1 is weaker than the assumption in OLS, because the time-invariant factor $\alpha_i$ is captured by the fixed effect.
    - Example: Unobserved ability is caputured by $\alpha_i$.
- Assumption 2 allows for serial correlation (i.e., $Cov(x_{it},x_{it'} ) \neq 0$ ) within individual $i$.
    - This is related to the cluster-robust standard error. 
- Assumption 4 seems as usual, but it has an important role in panel data analysis.
- Consider the following regression with unit FE
$$
wage_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 experience_{it} + \beta_2 male_{i} + \beta_3 white_{i} + \alpha_i + u_{it}
$$
where $experience_{it}$ measures how many years worker $i$ has worked before at time $t$.
    - In the regression above, we have multicollinearity issue because of $male_{i}$ and $white_{i}$.
    - Intuitively, we cannot estimate the coefficient $\beta_2$ and $\beta_3$ because those **time-invariant** variables are completely captured by the unit fixed effect $\alpha_i$. 

## Estimation (within transformation)

- You can estimate the model by adding dummy variables for each individual. This is called **least square dummy variables (LSDV) estimator**.
- This is computationary demanding if we have many cross-sectional observations. 
- We often use the following **within transformation**.
- Define the new variable $\tilde{Y}_{it}$ as 
$$
\tilde{Y}_{it} = Y_{it} - \bar{Y}_i
$$
where $\bar{Y}_i = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T Y_{it}$. 
- Why is this useful? By applying the within transformation to the regression model, we can eliminate the unit fixed effect $\alpha_i$
$$
\tilde{Y}_{it} = \beta' \tilde{X}_{it} + \tilde{u}_{it}
$$
Then apply the OLS estimator to the above equation!.

## Importance of within variation

- As I talked before, the variation of the explanatory variable is key for precisely estimating the coefficients (once we control for the endogeneity).
- Within transformation eliminates the time-invariant unobserved factor, which is a large source of endogeneity in many situations. 
- But, within transformation also absorbs the variation of $X_{it}$. 
- Remember that 
$$
\tilde{X}_{it} = X_{it} - \bar{X}_i
$$
- The transformed variable $\tilde{X}_{it}$ has the variation over time $t$ within unit $i$.
- If $X_{it}$ is fixed over time within unit $i$, $\tilde{X}_{it} = 0$, so that no variation.

## FE, FE, and FE

- In addition to unit FE, you can also add **time fixed effects (FE)**
$$
y_{it} = \beta' x_{it} + \alpha_i + \gamma_t + u_{it}
$$
- The regression above controls for both **time-invariant individual heterogeneity** and **(unobserved) aggregate year shock**.
- Panel data is useful to capture various unobserved shock by including fixed effects.

## Panel + IV

- You can use IV regression with panel data.

## Standard Errors

- In the cross-section data, we need to use the heteroskedasticity robust standard error.
    - Remember: Heteroskedasticity means $Var(u_i | x_i) = \sigma(x_i)$.
- In the panel data setting, we need to consider the **autocorrelation** of the variable, that is the correlation between $u_{it}$ and $u_{it'}$ across periods for each individual $i$.
- The current standard is to use so-called **cluster-robust standard error**.
    - The cluster is unit $i$. The observations within cluster are allowed to be freely correlated. 
    - Cluster-robust standard error takes care for such correlation. 
- I will explain how to deal with this in R.
