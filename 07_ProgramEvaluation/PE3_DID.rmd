# Introduction

## Introduction

-   Difference-in-differences (DID)
    -   Exploit the panel data structure to estimate the causal effect.
\bigskip
-   Consider that
    -   Treatment and control group comparison: selection bias
    -   Before v.s. After comparison: time trend
\bigskip
-   DID combines those two comparisons to draw causal conclusion.

# Framework

## Framework

-   Consider two periods: $t=1,2$. Treatment implemented at $t=2$.
\bigskip
-   $Y_{it}$: observed outcome for person $i$ in period $t$
\bigskip
-   $G_{i}$: dummy for treatment group
\bigskip
-   $D_{it}$: treatment status
\bigskip
    -   $D_{it}=1$ if $t=2$ and $G_{i}=1$
-   *potential outcomes*
    -   $Y_{it}(1)$: outcome for $i$ when she is treated
    -   $Y_{it}(0)$: outcome for $i$ when she is not treated
\bigskip
-   With this, we can write $$\begin{aligned}
    Y_{it} & =D_{it}Y_{it}(1)+(1-D_{it})Y_{it}(0)\end{aligned}$$

## Identification

-   Goal: ATT at $t=2$
    $$E[Y_{i2}(1)-Y_{i2}(0)|G_{i}=1]=E[Y_{i2}(1)|G_{i}=1]-E[Y_{i2}(0)|G_{i}=1]$$
-   What we observe

                                 Pre-period ($t=1$)          Post ($t=2)$
      ----------------------- ------------------------ ------------------------
       Treatment ($G_{i}=1$)   $E[Y_{i1}(0)|G_{i}=1]$   $E[Y_{i2}(1)|G_{i}=1]$
        Control ($G_{i}=0)$    $E[Y_{i1}(0)|G_{i}=0]$   $E[Y_{i2}(0)|G_{i}=0]$

-   Under what assumptions can we the ATT?
    -   Simple comparison if
        $E[Y_{i2}(0)|G_{i}=1]=E[Y_{i2}(0)|G_{i}=0]$.
    -   Before-after comparison if
        $E[Y_{i2}(0)|G_{i}=1]=E[Y_{i1}(0)|G_{i}=1]$.
    -   Other (more reasonable) assumption?

## Parallel Trend Assumption

-   Assumption:
    $$E[Y_{i2}(0)-Y_{i1}(0)|G_{i}=0]=E[Y_{i2}(0)-Y_{i1}(0)|G_{i}=1]$$
    -   Change in the outcome *without treatment* is the same
        across two groups.
\bigskip
-   Then, $$\begin{aligned}
    \underbrace{E[Y_{i2}(1)-Y_{i2}(0)|G_{i}=1]}_{ATT}= & E[Y_{i2}(1)|G_{i}=1]-E[Y_{i2}(0)|G_{i}=1]\\
    = & E[Y_{i2}(1)|G_{i}=1]-E[Y_{i1}(0)|G_{i}=1]\\
     & -\underbrace{(E[Y_{i2}(0)|G_{i}=1]-E[Y_{i1}(0)|G_{i}=1])}_{=E[Y_{i2}(0)-Y_{i1}(0)|G_{i}=0]\ (pararell\ trend)}\end{aligned}$$

--- 

-   Thus, $$\begin{aligned}
    ATT= & E[Y_{i2}(1)-Y_{i1}(0)|G_{i}=1]-E[Y_{i2}(0)-Y_{i1}(0)|G_{i}=0]\end{aligned}$$
    which is why this is called "difference-in-differences".

# Estimation

## Estimation Approach

1.  Plug-in estimator

2.  Regression estimators

## Plug-in Estimator

-   Remember that the ATT is $$\begin{aligned}
    ATT= & E[Y_{i2}(1)-Y_{i1}(0)|G_{i}=1]-E[Y_{i2}(0)-Y_{i1}(0)|G_{i}=0]\end{aligned}$$

-   Replace them with the sample average. $$\begin{aligned}
    \hat{ATT=} & \left\{ \bar{y}(t=2,G=1)-\bar{y}(t=1,G=1)\right\} \\
     & -\left\{ \bar{y}(t=2,G=0)-\bar{y}(t=1,G=0)\right\} \end{aligned}$$
    where $\bar{y}(t,G)$ is the sample average for group $G$ in period
    $t$ .
\bigskip
-   Easy to make a $2\times2$ table!

## Example: Card and Kruger (1994)

![image](figure_table/CardKruger1994Table3.pdf)

## Regression Estimators

-   Run the following regression
    $$y_{it}=\alpha_{0}+\alpha_{1}G_{i}+\alpha_{2}T_{t}+\alpha_{3}D_{it}+\beta X_{it}+\epsilon_{it}$$

    -   $G_{i}$: dummy for treatment group

    -   $T_{t}:$dummy for treatment period

    -   $D_{it}=G_{i}\times T_{t}.$ $\alpha_{3}$ captures the ATT.
\bigskip
-   Regression framework can incorporate covariates $X_{it}$, which is
    important to control for observed confounding factors.

## Regression Estimators with FEs

-   With panel data
    $$y_{it}=\alpha D_{it}+\beta X_{it}+\epsilon_{i}+\epsilon_{t}+\epsilon_{it}$$
    where $\epsilon_{i}$ is individual FE and $\epsilon_{t}$ is time FE.
\bigskip
-   Do not forget to use the cluster-robust standard errors!
    -   See Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullainathan (2004, QJE) for the
        standard error issues.

# Parallel Trend

## Discussions on Parallel Trend

-   Parallel trend assumption can be violated in various situations.
\bigskip
-   Most critical issue: Treatment may depend on *time-varying factors*
    -   DID can only deal with **time-invariant factors**.
\bigskip
-   Self-selection: participants in worker training programs experience
    a decrease in earnings before they enter the program
\bigskip
-   Targeting: policies may be targeted at units that are currently
    performing best (or worst).

## Diagnostics for Parallel Trends: Pre-treatment trends

-   Check if the trends are parallel in the pre-treatment periods
\bigskip
-   Requires data on multiple pre-treatment periods (the more the
    better)
\bigskip
-   This is very popular. You MUST do this if you have multiple
    pre-treatment periods.
\bigskip
-   Note: this is only diagnostics, NEVER a direct test of the
    assumption!
    -   You should never say "the key assumption for DID is satisfied if
        the pre-treatment trends are parallel.

## Example (Fig 5.2 from Mastering Metrics)

![image](figure_table/MMfig52.pdf)

--- 

## Unit-Specific Time Trends

-   Add group-specific time trends as
    $$y_{it}=\alpha D_{it}+\beta_{1}G_{i}\times t+\epsilon_{i}+\epsilon_{t}+\epsilon_{it}$$
\bigskip
-   To see whether including the time trend does not change estimates
    that much. (robustness check)
\bigskip
-   Note that
    -   These time trends are meant to capture the trend in each group.
    -   At least 3 periods of the data is needed.
    -   But, these are assumed to be linear. We are not sure whether the
        trend is linear or not! So this is just a robustness check.

## Other Diagnostics: Placebo test

-   Placebo test using other period as treatment period.
    $$y_{it}=\sum_{\tau}\gamma_{\tau}G_{i}\times I_{t,\tau}+\mu_{i}+\nu_{t}+\epsilon_{it}$$
    -   The estimates of $\gamma_{\tau}$ should be close to zero up to
        the beggining of treatment (Fig 5.2.4 of Angrist and Pischke)
\bigskip
-   Placebo test using different dependent variable which should not be
    affected by the policy.

# Research Strategy

## Research Strategy using DID

-   Ishise et al (2019)
    1.  How to find a research question
    2.  What outcome dataset to look for
    3.  What policy to look for (except for example 1 and 2).
